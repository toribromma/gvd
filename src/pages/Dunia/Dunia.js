          master-planned mixed retail development emphasizing restaurants,
          hospitality and power retailers such as Kohlâ€™s, Loweâ€™s and Wal-Mart.

          each phase operating independently as well as enhancing subsequent
          phases as developed. The project is a joint venture with the Dunia
